* Simple authorization (super easy - just type `admin` as a username and `123456` as a password :) )
* _Favorite movies_ is a protected route for unauthorized users
* Store saved movies in VueX store and in a browser local storage
* Each card has a list of its genres, each of which leads to the movie list of this genre
